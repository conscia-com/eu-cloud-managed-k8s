# ClusterAPI

ClusterAPI is a Kubernetes project that provides declarative APIs and tooling to manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to create, configure, and manage clusters in a consistent way across different infrastructure providers.

This repository contains examples and instructions for setting up ClusterAPI for Scaleway and Hetzner.

In my example I use local kind clusters as management clusters. In production you would use a more robust management cluster, such as a dedicated Kubernetes cluster in your cloud provider.
